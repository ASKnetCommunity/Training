    description: "The Orbit Chart is a strategic planning tool to guide decision-making around the priority areas of your hub. You can plan for 12 months or three years â€“ whatever makes sense for your hub. Every hub will emphasise different components which may change over time. The Orbit Chart visualises the key drivers for your hub to guide decision-making and help you keep on track to achieving your goals." #Make a rough strategic plan for the future.
