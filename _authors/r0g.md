The r0g_agency is a nonprofit (gGmbH) that was founded in Berlin in 2013 by Susanne Bellinghausen and Stephen Kovats. After starting out in coworking spaces, the r0g_agency moved to its current location in Berlin-Charlottenburg in 2017.

The r0g_agency was founded to combine on the ground work with open source methodologies in order to foster innovation and address structural problems in Juba, the new capital of the newly formed South Sudan. This work later became part of the #ASKnet project.

Over time the scope of our work increased to include a focus on peacebuilding, online hate speech mitigation (as part of our #defyhatenow program), and creating safe and reliable sources of information on migration issues (as part of our #migrant media network).

At the r0g_agency, we value diversity in all of its forms and we believe in being an open, inclusive, and affirming work environment.
